    <h3><b>New Zealand's government has declared that American far-right groups the Proud Boys and The Base are terrorist organizations.</b> </h3>
    <h4>
        The two groups join 18 others including the Islamic State group that have been given an official <br> terrorist designation, making it illegal in New Zealand to fund, <br> recruit or participate in the groups, and obligating authorities to take action against them.

    <h4>
        The U.S. groups are not known to be active in New Zealand, although the South Pacific nation has <br> become more attuned to threats from the far right after a white supremacist shot and killed <br> 51 Muslim worshippers at two Christchurch mosques in 2019. <br> <br>

        The New Zealand massacre inspired other white supremacists around the world, including a white <br> gunman who killed 10 Black people at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York, in May.
